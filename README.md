This website is not an actively hosted domain... this was created as a local school project using HTML. I am open to solutions and tips to improve the website and/or its contents/my coding skills(which kinda suck)
Do not add any malicious code and/or trojans and viruses... I made it open-source for a reason!
Please state the purpose of a code change when made
Tips and tricks for HTML coding and/or javascript would be the best!
