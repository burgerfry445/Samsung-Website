<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#f7f7ff"><I><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="MONACO"> Samsung is one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world. Yet, its history doesn't even start in electronics. Samsung was created on January 13, 1969, by Lee Byung-Chul. Samsung started as a grocer in South Korea selling noodles and dried fish. Samsung made its first-ever black and white TV in 1969. In the 1970s, Samsung expanded its business to petrochemicals and even partnered with BP to create Samsung BP Chemicals. They further expanded their business into home appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, and microwaves. Samsung went deeper into TVs, made the first digital colour TV, and created VCRs, Blu-Ray players, tape recorders, and MP3 players. Samsung created their first phone in the 1980s, with their first phone not working and the entire stock being burned down by Lee Byung-Chul, making Samsung take mobile phones seriously. Samsung also invested in storage devices, such as Compact Flash, and processors, which are still a big part of Samsung's market to this day.              </FONT></I></CENTER></P>
<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#f7f7ff"><I><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="MONACO">In 2010, Samsung created their first flagship Android phone called the Galaxy S. The Galaxy S sold 1 million units within the first 45 days. This lead on for Samsung to continue creating new phones in the S series, and currently sell the S series, the A series, the M series, and the Z series. Samsung's main headquarters is located in South Korea, and is called Samsung Digital City. Samsung Digital City has an entire studio for creating their iconic ringtones and the popular Over The Horizon. They do extensive research and tests for the durability of their phones. Samsung hit the world record for the largest TV, at 102". Samusung uses Android today, but had their own operating system for a while, which was called Bada OS. Bada ran on the Samsung Wave and was a complete flop due to lack of applications, making Samsung switch back to Android. Samsung today makes phones and appliances in US, but make buildings, planes, cars, and toilet seats in South Korea. Samsung has a basketball team, life insurance, an EA sports team, and an entire amusement park.  </FONT></I></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#f7f7ff"><I><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="MONACO">Samsung is also not afraid to experiment and innovate. Samsung created the Beam Series, a phone with a built in projector, which was THICC. They also created the first foldable phone and folded hotdog style, the Galaxy Fold, which was also THICC, which although had an initial fatal flaw where the attatched film on the screen was removed and damaged the phones. However, Samsung has continued to release new foldable phones including the new Z Flip, which folded hamburger style and sold very well</FONT></I></CENTER></P>

The heart beat sensor, for instance, is unique for the Galaxy S5, while something like the Finger Scanner can also be observed on the iPhone 5s, but in a rather different implementation. Samsung also introduced two new launch colors, including Copper Gold, and a brand new perforated design for the rear cover. The addition of Snapdragon 801 chipset brings on LTE-A download speeds, and 4K video recording, to an already superb handset.</p></font>

The screen is also taller, allowing the phone to be manageable in one hand, all while providing plentiful display space. Like it or not, the physical buttons have been replaced with on-screen ones, while the fingerprint scanner has been re-positioned on the back. The camera is similar to the one on the Galaxy S7, but the improved software allows the phone to deliver better photos by stitching areas of multiple frames together. On the hardware front, the Snapdragon 835 provides plenty of processing power, all while being more energy efficient than its predecessors.</p></center></font></I>
